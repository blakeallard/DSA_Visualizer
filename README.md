## Why This Exists

Writing a solution is one thing. *Understanding* it is another.

Most algorithm practice stops at correctness — you get the right answer, move on. This project takes a different approach: every algorithm is reconstructed as a live visual simulation so you can **watch** it think.

> The goal isn't just to pass the interview. It's to build algorithmic intuition that sticks.

---

## Visualizations

| Problem | Category | What You'll See |
|---|---|---|
| 🌀 **Spiral Matrix** | Matrix Traversal | Boundary contraction, direction switching, layer peeling |
| 🔍 **Search 2D Matrix** | Binary Search | Coordinate mapping, mid-point targeting, elimination zones |
| 📦 **Heap Insert** | Heap / Trees | Node placement, parent comparisons, sift-up restructuring |

> More problems added continuously as I progress through advanced algorithm patterns.

---

## What Each Visualization Exposes

Rather than just showing a final answer, each simulation reveals:

```
Pointer movement       →  watch indices shift in real time
State transitions      →  see exactly when conditions flip
Traversal mechanics    →  follow the path step by step
Heap restructuring     →  observe sift-up/sift-down live
Matrix boundary logic  →  see the shrinking search space
Binary search flow     →  track the elimination of possibilities
```

## Tech Stack

```
No frameworks. No build tools. No dependencies.
```

| Layer | Choice | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Structure | HTML | Semantic, zero overhead |
| Style | CSS | Custom animations, zero bloat |
| Logic | Vanilla JavaScript | Full control, no abstraction layer |
| Deploy | GitHub Pages | Instant, automatic, free |

Every problem is **fully self-contained** in its own directory. Open any `index.html` directly in a browser — it just works.
